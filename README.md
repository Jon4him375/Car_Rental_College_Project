# Car_Rental_College_Project
College project created with 3 other team members. Created using Asp.NET Core connected to an SQL database. The project was a car rental application that has both a customer and an admin side to it. Allows for a customer to create an account and offers authentication. Also, allows for the admin to make changes, such as editing/creating/deleting car items that are shown. The car item consists of a bunch of fields that can be modified. There are also categories of cars that help with organization; these can be modified in the same way. These admin features are only shown if an admin is signed in. The SQL database has 9 different tables, where most have foreign key connections to other tables (e.g. Vehicle table has storeID that connects with the Store table)
